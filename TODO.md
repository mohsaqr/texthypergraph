# texthypergraph — consolidated todos

Each item names its target repo. The Nestimate-side items also live in
`Nestimate/todo/COVERAGE-CATCHUP.md`; this file is the superset with the
text/NLP framing. Checked 2026-08-24: none of these exist anywhere on
CRAN.

## Nestimate (statistical R core)

DONE 2026-08-25 in Nestimate `R/hypergraph_laplacian.R` (all three
verbs; HyperNetX parity \< 1e-12, brute-force formula tests, 64 shipped
assertions). **Weighted hypergraph Laplacian + spectral clustering +
transductive classification** (Zhou, Huang & Schölkopf 2006 —
`papers/2006-NeurIPS- LearningWithHypergraphs-Zhou.pdf`). One Laplacian
unlocks three verbs: clustering (fits `cluster_data()` family),
transductive label spreading (THE non-neural text classifier — no R
implementation exists), and spectral embedding. Oracles:
`HyperG::hypergraph_laplacian_matrix` / `cluster_spectral` for the
unweighted case; **HyperNetX `norm_lap`/`spec_clus` (verified:
implements Hayashi EDVW exactly) via reticulate for the weighted case**;
hand-computed small cases.

**Windowed sequence hyperedges** for `build_hypergraph()` (HyperGAT
construction, our weighted/windowed extension — no upstream oracle;
invariants: window-count conservation, w = 2 reduces to
`wtna_cooccurrence`). Details in Nestimate COVERAGE-CATCHUP §3.

**Hypergraph random-walk centrality / PageRank with edge-dependent
vertex weights** (Chitra & Raphael 2019 —
`papers/2019-ICML- HypergraphRW-Chitra.pdf`). Sibling to the shipped Z/H
tensor centralities in `hypergraph_centrality()`; their Thm-level
result: edge-INdependent weights collapse to a graph random walk, so the
edge-dependent case is where hypergraphs genuinely add information.

DONE 2026-08-25 (covered by the same implementation:
`hypergraph_cluster(hg, type = "random_walk")` on a weighted incidence
IS EDVW clustering; oracle parity verified). **EDVW spectral clustering
— the UNSUPERVISED tier-2 method** (Hayashi, Aksoy, Park & Park 2020 —
`papers/2020-CIKM-HypergraphClustering- Hayashi.pdf`, verified).
Edge-dependent vertex weights (e.g. tf-idf of word-in-document) give a
weighted incidence matrix -\> random-walk Laplacians -\> spectral / NMF
clustering; demonstrated on term-document data, beats plain spectral
baselines. Builds on the Chitra & Raphael theory; shares ALL machinery
with the Zhou Laplacian item above (one extra weighting argument,
e.g. `vertex_weights=` on the incidence). No R implementation exists.
This is the better-than-LDA unsupervised route that stays fully
statistical/interpretable. Oracle: HyperNetX `laplacians_clustering`
(author-adjacent implementation, verified 2026-08-25).

**kNN embedding hypergraph (tier-3 -\> tier-2 bridge)**: each document +
its k nearest neighbors in a contrastive-embedding space (SimCSE / E5 /
BGE class) = one hyperedge, weights from cosine similarity; then the
Zhou/Hayashi spectral machinery clusters it with an explicit Laplacian
instead of black-box UMAP+HDBSCAN, and `hypergraph_measures()` /
`hypergraph_centrality()` describe the result. Unweighted precedent:
`HyperG::knn_hypergraph()` (usable as a construction oracle). R
pipeline: `text::textEmbed()` (reticulate/HF) -\> Nestimate. Candidate
shape: a `knn_hypergraph(embeddings, k, weight = "cosine")` builder or
an input mode of `build_hypergraph()`. Vignette-first: prove the
pipeline on a real corpus before deciding the API. Doesn’t exist in R.
Caveats to encode: multi-seed stability (stochastic embedders are not,
but k choice is a sensitivity axis) and encoder-dependence reported per
the house statistical rules.

`wasserstein_distance()` +
[`dual_hypergraph()`](https://mohsaqr.github.io/texthypergraph/reference/dual_hypergraph.md)
— see Nestimate COVERAGE-CATCHUP §1/§2.

**NLP bridge vignette**: `quanteda` dfm / `tidytext` long table →
`bipartite_groups(long, player = "word", group = "doc", weight = "n")` →
measures / centrality / (once landed) Laplacian classification. No new
code — documentation of an existing path.

**XGI as second oracle for shipped `hypergraph_centrality()`**: XGI has
`h_eigenvector_`/`z_eigenvector_`/`clique_eigenvector_centrality`
(verified in docs 2026-08-25) — add a reticulate cross-check to
Nestimate’s `local_testing_and_equivalence/test-equiv-hypergraph.R`
alongside the existing igraph/clean-room references.

## Saqrlab (simulation)

Random hypergraph samplers (gnp, SBM, k-uniform/regular) — oracle
`HyperG::sample_*` for unweighted; needed for calibration studies of the
Nestimate verbs above.

## carm-text / carm-ml (JS side, if ever)

Hypergraph layer for carm-text: incidence structure from its existing
tokenizer/topic-model outputs + the Zhou Laplacian in JS. Neural
variants (HGNN → AllSet, `papers/`) only if a GNN story ever lands in
carm-ml. PLMs (XLNet etc.) stay out of scope everywhere — R/JS access is
wrapper-only (HF `transformers` via reticulate / `text` pkg).

## Reading order (papers/)

0.  `2022-TIST-TextClassificationSurvey-Li.pdf` — umbrella background
    (supervised, through GCN; stops before hypergraphs).
1.  `2006-NeurIPS-LearningWithHypergraphs-Zhou.pdf` — the Laplacian
    everything else builds on; directly implementable.
2.  `2019-ICML-HypergraphRW-Chitra.pdf` — random-walk spectral theory,
    edge-dependent vertex weights. 2b.
    `2020-CIKM-HypergraphClustering-Hayashi.pdf` — EDVW clustering built
    on (2); the unsupervised method to implement.
3.  `2020-EMNLP-HyperGAT-Ding.pdf` — text hypergraph construction + dual
    attention (construction verified in their repo, see README).
4.  `2019-EMNLP-HGAT-Linmei.pdf` — topic/entity heterogeneous
    predecessor.
5.  `2019-AAAI-HGNN-Feng.pdf`, `2019-NeurIPS-HyperGCN-Yadati.pdf`,
    `2020-HNHN-Dong.pdf`, `2022-ICLR-AllSet-Chien.pdf` — the neural
    lineage, in order.
6.  `2019-NeurIPS-XLNet-Yang.pdf` — PLM baseline context only.
