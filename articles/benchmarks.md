# Benchmarks: R8, R52, MR, Ohsumed, 20NG

How far does closed-form hypergraph label spreading go on the five
standard text-classification benchmarks? This article reports test-set
accuracy of `text_hypergraph(sparse = TRUE)` +
[`hg_classify()`](https://mohsaqr.github.io/texthypergraph/reference/hg_classify.md)
on R8, R52, MR, Ohsumed, and 20-Newsgroups, against a tf-idf
nearest-centroid baseline and against the published accuracy tables in
Ding et al. (2020). Every number below was produced by the harness in
`benchmarks/` of the package repository; nothing is copied from memory.

## Setup

The corpora and train/test splits are the exact files of Yao, Mao & Luo
(2019), which Ding et al. (2020) also use – any other cleaning would
make the numbers incomparable. `benchmarks/download.sh` fetches them.
Each dataset becomes a sparse document–word hypergraph (documents are
vertices, words are hyperedges, tf-idf incidence weights); the training
documents are the labeled seeds; the spreading solution classifies every
test document in one conjugate-gradient solve per class.

``` r

hg <- text_hypergraph(docs, weight = "tfidf", sparse = TRUE)
fit <- hg_classify(hg, labels = train_labels, normalization = "class_mass")
```

Two checks tie the pipeline to the published setup. The split sizes
match Ding et al.’s Table 1 exactly on all five datasets. The vocabulary
sizes match exactly on R8 (7,688 hyperedges) and R52 (8,892); on MR,
Ohsumed and 20NG ours are smaller (18,151 vs 18,764; 13,349 vs 14,157;
36,970 vs 42,757) because the package tokenizer drops digit-containing
tokens. MR has one document unreachable from the rest of the corpus; the
harness runs on the giant component and would score unreachable test
documents as errors (here that document is not in the test set).

## Full-split results

`accuracy` is test-set accuracy with a 1,000-resample percentile
bootstrap CI; `fit_s` is the wall-clock seconds for the transductive
solve itself.

``` r

results <- read.csv("benchmark-results.csv")
knitr::kable(
  subset(results,
         select = c(dataset, method, accuracy, ci_low, ci_high, macro_f1,
                    build_s, fit_s)),
  digits = 4
)
```

| mr | tfidf_centroid | 0.6851 | 0.6708 | 0.7006 | 0.6850 | 3.045 | 0.007 |

Three findings. First, on the two class-balanced datasets the hypergraph
classifier beats the centroid baseline outright: 0.8477 vs 0.7796 on
20NG and 0.7684 vs 0.6851 on MR. Second, on the skewed multi-class
corpora (R8, R52, Ohsumed) the centroid wins; label spreading pays for
class imbalance even after normalization, and R52’s 52 heavily skewed
classes are its worst case (0.5284 vs 0.8797). Third, the
`hypergraph_zhou` rows – the raw Zhou (2006) argmax with no
normalization – collapse onto the majority class (0.4947 on R8 is
exactly the majority-class rate; 0.1020 on 20NG), which is why
`normalization = "class_mass"` (Zhu, Ghahramani & Lafferty 2003) exists
and is used everywhere else in this article. The EDVW walk
(`hypergraph_random_walk_cmn`) is best on Ohsumed (0.5110 vs 0.4702) and
second elsewhere.

The cost side: the largest solve – 20 classes over 18,846 documents x
36,970 hyperedges – fits in 1.2 seconds on a laptop CPU, with no
training, no gradient steps and no GPU. Ding et al.’s Table 3 reports
1,479 MB of GPU memory for TextGCN and 180 MB for HyperGAT on the same
corpus.

## Against the published tables

Published rows are means over 10 runs from Ding et al. (2020), Table 2;
our transductive rows are deterministic given the split.

``` r

published <- read.csv("benchmark-published.csv")
knitr::kable(published, digits = 4)
```

| dataset | model                  | accuracy |     sd | source                    |

| 20ng    | fastText               |   0.7938 | 0.0030 | Ding et al. 2020, Table 2 |
| R8      | fastText               |   0.9613 | 0.0021 | Ding et al. 2020, Table 2 |
| R52     | fastText               |   0.9281 | 0.0009 | Ding et al. 2020, Table 2 |
| ohsumed | fastText               |   0.5770 | 0.0049 | Ding et al. 2020, Table 2 |
| mr      | fastText               |   0.7514 | 0.0020 | Ding et al. 2020, Table 2 |

On 20NG the hypergraph classifier (0.8477) is within two points of
transductive TextGCN (0.8643) and HyperGAT (0.8662), and above fastText
(0.7938). On MR (0.7684) it edges out published transductive TextGCN
(0.7674) and trails HyperGAT (0.7832). On R8, R52 and Ohsumed the
trained models are clearly ahead. The honest summary: a closed-form
spectral method with zero trained parameters recovers most of the
accuracy of trained graph neural networks on balanced corpora and is not
competitive on skewed ones.

## The low-label regime

Label spreading is designed for few labels, so the full-split table
above is its worst case. Here the training seeds are subsampled
(stratified, at least one per class, five draws per fraction; the SD
column is over draws) and both methods receive the same seeds.

``` r

lowlabel <- read.csv("benchmark-lowlabel.csv")
knitr::kable(lowlabel, digits = 4)
```

| dataset | fraction | n_seeds | method              | accuracy |     sd | n_draws |

| ohsumed |     0.20 |     678 | tfidf_centroid      |   0.5463 | 0.0026 |       5 |

On MR the hypergraph classifier leads at every fraction, from 72 seeds
(0.5675 vs 0.5541) to 1,422 seeds (0.6984 vs 0.6677): with few labels,
the document–word structure carries information the centroid cannot use.
On R8 and Ohsumed the centroid stays ahead at every fraction – strong
tf-idf class signatures survive subsampling better than spreading does.
Few labels help the case for structure, but they do not overturn the
class balance effect.

## The neural tier: HGNN

[`hg_neural()`](https://mohsaqr.github.io/texthypergraph/reference/hg_neural.md)
trains the two-layer hypergraph convolutional network of Feng et
al. (2019) natively in R ({torch}), on the same sparse document–word
hypergraph and tf-idf features. Its propagation matrix is exactly the
Zhou operator the transductive classifier spreads with – verified to
machine precision in the tests, with forward-pass parity against the
official implementation (DHG) at float32 precision. Training is
stochastic, so every number is the mean of three seeds (SD and range
shown); each run holds out 10% of the seeds (stratified) to pick the
best epoch. Two configurations are reported: the original paper’s
(`lr = 0.001`, 200 epochs, tuned for citation graphs with dense
features) and the package default (`lr = 0.01`, 600 epochs, selected by
validation accuracy for high-dimensional sparse text features).

``` r

neural <- read.csv("benchmark-neural.csv")
knitr::kable(
  subset(neural,
         select = c(dataset, epochs, lr, accuracy, sd, acc_min, acc_max,
                    macro_f1, fit_s)),
  digits = 4
)
```

The tuned configuration lifts R8 to 0.9539 (above the centroid’s 0.9246;
published TextGCN 0.9707) and R52 to 0.8440 (a 32-point jump over
transduction’s 0.5284, though still under the centroid), and holds MR at
0.7692 – the best number in this article for that dataset. On Ohsumed
and 20NG, however, HGNN underperforms the closed-form transduction at
every configuration tested (20NG: 0.5355 tuned, 0.6347 at paper
defaults, vs 0.8477 for transduction). The loss curves say this is not
an optimization failure alone: the corpus-level document-node design
oversmooths – two rounds of propagation through high-degree word
hyperedges blur exactly the distinctions 20 newsgroups need. The
literature’s answer is document-level hypergraphs with attention over
hyperedges (HyperGAT), which is the next stage of the package roadmap.

## When to use which

Use `hg_classify(normalization = "class_mass")` when classes are roughly
balanced or labels are scarce, and always over the raw argmax: the raw
rule’s majority-class collapse on skewed seeds is total. Use
`type = "random_walk"` when tf-idf weights should shape the walk itself;
it was best on Ohsumed here. Use
[`hg_neural()`](https://mohsaqr.github.io/texthypergraph/reference/hg_neural.md)
when plentiful labels can pay for training: it holds the package’s best
R8 (0.9539), R52 (0.8440) and MR (0.7692) numbers, but do not expect it
to beat the closed-form classifier on every corpus – on 20NG it does
not, at any configuration tested. For skewed many-class corpora a tf-idf
centroid remains a strong, nearly free baseline, and the trained graph
models (TextGCN, HyperGAT) hold the published state of the art. The
package’s contribution is that every non-published row above runs
natively in R – the transductive ones in seconds, the neural ones in
minutes on a CPU – each from one verb.
