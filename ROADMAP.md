# texthypergraph — package roadmap

2026-08-25 (v3 — pivoted from "staging ground" to **the `texthypergraph` R
package**). This repo becomes the package; the papers/, repos/, and TODO.md
material stays as its research base (`.Rbuildignore`d).

**What the package is:** hypergraph text analysis in R — corpus in, weighted
text hypergraph out, spectral/statistical analysis through tidy verbs. First
of its kind on CRAN (gap verified 2026-08-24: no hypergraph text
classification exists in R at all, not even non-neural Zhou 2006).

**Ownership contract (no duplication):**

- `texthypergraph` owns: text → hypergraph **constructions**, text-facing
  analysis verbs, corpora, vignettes.
- `Nestimate` (Imports, via mohsaqr.r-universe.dev) is a **frozen
  dependency** (decision 2026-08-25: Nestimate is not being expanded). Its
  shipped engines are used as-is: `bipartite_groups()`,
  `hypergraph_measures()`, `hypergraph_centrality()` (CEC + tensor Z/H),
  the Zhou/Hayashi Laplacian trio, `clique_expansion()`, `wtna()`.
  **Every NEW method is implemented in texthypergraph**, with its own
  oracle/invariant gates — nothing new goes into Nestimate.
- `sbert` (Suggests) is the native embedding front-end; every verb also
  accepts a precomputed `embeddings` matrix so the package runs offline.
- Oracles (local-only, never dependencies): HyperNetX (EDVW Laplacian,
  verified author-adjacent), XGI (tensor centralities), HyperG (unweighted
  constructions/samplers), gudhi (wasserstein). Full map: `repos/README.md`.

**Filter (house rules):** deterministic, base R + the two family Imports,
tidy one-verb APIs, every method oracle-tested before release, effect sizes +
CIs in vignettes, multi-seed sensitivity for every arbitrary choice (k,
window, threshold).

## v0.1 — Scaffold + the bridge (no new math)

**Status 2026-08-25: v0.1 COMPLETE.** Skeleton, `text_hypergraph()`
(+ curly-apostrophe normalization), `stop_words_en()`, four delegating verbs
(+ `sort_by`/`n` on centrality), `covid_abstracts` dataset (165 abstracts,
2020-2024), full worked vignette (clustering + k-sensitivity + few-label
classification with verified numbers), package README. 74 tests pass, engine
parity `identical()`, R CMD check 0 errors / 0 warnings / 1 environmental
NOTE.

- Package skeleton: DESCRIPTION, testthat 3e, pkgdown, CI matrix;
  papers/repos/TODO/ROADMAP `.Rbuildignore`d.
- `text_hypergraph(x, column, weight = c("n", "tfidf"))` — document–word
  incidence from raw text or any long table (base-R tokenization; quanteda
  dfm / tidytext tables accepted as inputs, never dependencies).
- Thin tidy verbs delegating to Nestimate: `hg_measures()`, `hg_centrality()`,
  `hg_cluster()`, `hg_classify()` (transduction), `hg_embed()` — one call,
  named arguments, tidy data.frame returns, print/summary/plot +
  `as.data.frame()` per house rules.
- Bundled corpus + the bridge vignette (the Phase-1 vignette, now living
  here instead of Nestimate).
- Gate: `--as-cran` clean; parity of every delegated verb against direct
  Nestimate calls (`identical()`).

## v0.2 — Text-native constructions

**Status 2026-08-25: v0.2 COMPLETE.** Both constructions shipped:
`text_hypergraph(construction = "window")` (sliding/tumbling, set-valued
window hyperedges; w = 2 off-diagonal parity with `Nestimate::wtna()`
shipped as a package test — diagonals differ by design, wtna counts
within-window repeats) and `construction = "knn"` + `knn_hypergraph()`
(cosine-weighted, deterministic tie-breaks, classed refusal of non-positive
similarities; binary support verified identical to `HyperG::knn_hypergraph`
in local_testing_and_equivalence/). `covid_embeddings` bundled (sbert
all-MiniLM-L6-v2, 165x384). `vignette("constructions")` demonstrates both
on the real corpus with w and k sensitivity checks. 136 tests; check
0 / 0 / 1 environmental NOTE. Version 0.2.0.

- **Windowed sequence hyperedges** — `text_hypergraph(construction =
  "window", w = )`: the HyperGAT construction, weighted/windowed extension.
  No upstream oracle; invariant-gated (window-count conservation; `w = 2`
  reduces exactly to `wtna_cooccurrence`).
- **kNN embedding hypergraph** — `knn_hypergraph(embeddings, k, weight =
  "cosine")` + `text_hypergraph(construction = "knn", model = )` calling
  sbert when installed. Construction oracle: `HyperG::knn_hypergraph`
  (unweighted). Vignette-first before the API freezes; k as a sensitivity
  axis, encoder-dependence reported per model.
- Gate: construction oracles/invariants + a real-corpus vignette for each.

## v0.3 — Theory completions (implemented HERE; Nestimate frozen)

**Status 2026-08-25: v0.3 COMPLETE** (hg_pagerank + dual_hypergraph +
hg_null_test; 180 tests; check 0/0/1 environmental NOTE; version 0.3.0).

- [x] DONE 2026-08-25: **`hg_pagerank()`** (Chitra & Raphael 2019 EDVW walk
  + damping/personalization). Four verification layers: direct linear-solve
  reference; collapse-theorem closed form (1e-12); Nestimate `$pi` parity
  (1e-12); HyperNetX `get_pi(prob_trans(weights=TRUE))` parity (1.4e-16).
- [x] DONE 2026-08-25: **`dual_hypergraph()`** — transpose identity,
  involution, and dual == opposite-orientation-construction tests shipped;
  HyperG::dual_hypergraph support parity PASS (local).
- [x] DONE 2026-08-25: **`hg_null_test()`** — degree-preserving
  checkerboard null (Gotelli 2000), permutation p (Phipson & Smyth 2010),
  null quantiles + z; margin-conservation and blocky-structure detection
  tests shipped; avg_edge_size invariance as built-in falsification.
- Gate: same discipline — hand-computed fixtures, invariants, oracle
  scripts, real-corpus vignette.

## v0.4 — Scale: sparse core (MANDATE 2026-08-25)

**Status 2026-08-25: sparse core SHIPPED** (bag construction, PageRank,
transduction via CG, RSpectra spectral clustering, measures, dual; window/
knn/tensor-centrality/null-test sparse paths still dense-only, guarded by
classed errors). Scale demo: 20,000 docs x 17,576 words — build 12.5s,
classify 0.6s (accuracy 1.000 on planted blocks), cluster 0.3s (perfect
partition), 14.4 MB sparse vs 2.8 GB dense equivalent. 291 tests; check
0/0/0. Version 0.4.0. The 20NG-class benchmarks (v0.5) are now feasible.

User verdict on v0.1-0.3: correct foundation, toy scale. The dense incidence
caps the package at hundreds of documents while the literature base
benchmarks on 7k-18k (Ohsumed, 20NG). v0.4 removes the ceiling:

- Sparse incidence (`Matrix::dgCMatrix`) as a first-class representation
  (`text_hypergraph(sparse = TRUE)`), same construction semantics.
- Sparse engines: EDVW transition + PageRank (sparse mat-vec), transduction
  via conjugate gradient on the operator (never materializing `solve`),
  spectral clustering via `RSpectra` partial eigenpairs on the similarity
  operator, structural measures on sparse cross-products.
- **Oracle: the shipped dense engines themselves** (Nestimate/HyperNetX-
  parity-verified) — sparse and dense must agree to 1e-8 on every small
  corpus; scale gate: 20k x 50k corpora construct + classify in minutes.

## v0.5 — Benchmarks: the papers' own yardstick

**Status 2026-08-25: SHIPPED.** Harness in `benchmarks/` (TextGCN
corpora/splits — the exact files HyperGAT preprocesses; split sizes match
Ding Table 1 on all five datasets, vocab exactly on R8/R52). Results
(`benchmarks/RESULTS.md`, pkgdown article `vignettes/articles/`):
20NG 0.8477 and MR 0.7684 beat the tf-idf centroid (0.7796 / 0.6851) and
fastText (published 0.7938); MR edges published TextGCN-transductive
(0.7674); skewed corpora (R8/R52/Ohsumed) go to the centroid — honest
both ways. Found + fixed a real method defect: raw Zhou argmax collapses
onto the majority class under imbalanced seeds (R8 0.4947 = the
majority-class rate) → new `normalization = "class_mass"` argument
(Zhu et al. 2003 CMN) on `hg_classify()`/`hypergraph_transduction()`,
fixture + invariance + parity + mutation tested. Low-label study
(stratified 1-20%, 5 draws): transduction leads the centroid at every
fraction on MR only. Version 0.5.0.

- R8 / R52 / MR / Ohsumed / 20NG harness (HyperGAT's Table 2 datasets);
  train/test splits as published.
- Zhou/EDVW transduction + tf-idf baselines vs the published accuracy
  tables; accuracy/F1 with bootstrap CIs; honest reporting either way.
- Results as a pkgdown article; harness reused by v0.6.

## v0.6 — Neural tier: hypergraph GNNs natively in R ({torch}, Suggests)

**Status 2026-08-26: HGNN SHIPPED** (`hg_neural()`, torch in Suggests,
version 0.6.0). Verified four ways: propagation == Zhou operator from the
in-package spectral core (1e-12); hand-computed weighted factorization;
forward parity vs the official DHG `HGNNConv` at 2.4e-7
(local_testing_and_equivalence/test-equiv-hgnn-dhg.R — note DHG
deduplicates identical hyperedges); mutation check. Benchmarks (3 seeds):
R8 0.9539, R52 0.8440, MR 0.7692 — package-best on all three; Ohsumed and
20NG stay below closed-form transduction at every configuration tested
(corpus-level doc-node design oversmooths; see the pkgdown article).
HyperGAT (document-level hypergraphs + dual attention) is the open half
of this stage and the expected answer to the 20NG/Ohsumed gap.

The no-neural rule is LIFTED (user decision 2026-08-25). First hypergraph
GNNs in R, no Python:

- HGNN (Feng 2019): spectral convolution on the Zhou Laplacian — the
  simplest layer, first.
- HyperGAT (Ding 2020): dual node-level/edge-level attention.
- Equivalence discipline for neural code: forward-pass parity against the
  official PyTorch implementations with fixed weights (reticulate,
  local_testing_and_equivalence/); training curves + benchmark accuracy
  vs the papers' tables via the v0.5 harness.

## v0.7 — Analytics depth

- `hg_embed()` (spectral embedding verb), eigengap/conductance cluster
  quality, per-cluster keyword extraction, ARI stability across seeds,
  larger bundled corpora.

## v1.0 — CRAN + the paper

- CRAN submission (the first-in-R claims re-verified against CRAN at
  submission).
- Flagship paper + vignette: **first fully-native R hypergraph text
  analysis** — sbert embeddings → kNN/windowed hyperedges → EDVW spectral
  clustering + transductive classification → tensor centralities; zero
  Python at runtime, oracle-verified against HyperNetX/XGI.
- BERTopic as the reported baseline (multi-seed, effect sizes + CIs).

## Out of scope

Neural training of any kind (HGNN/AllSet stay literature), PLM wrappers,
hMETIS/KaHyPar partitioning, retrieval stacks. Duplicating any Nestimate
engine here.
