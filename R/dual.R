# Dual hypergraph: swap the vertex and hyperedge roles. For a bag text
# hypergraph this is exactly the nodes = "doc"/"word" flip, available on a
# fitted object without re-tokenizing.

#' Dual of a hypergraph
#'
#' Returns the dual hypergraph: every hyperedge becomes a vertex and every
#' vertex becomes a hyperedge, with the transposed weighted incidence. For a
#' bag-construction [text_hypergraph()], the dual is identical to rebuilding
#' with the opposite `nodes` orientation (tested), so document-level and
#' word-level analyses can share one constructed object. Duals of windowed
#' and kNN hypergraphs are returned as plain `net_hypergraph` objects (their
#' corpus bookkeeping does not transpose meaningfully).
#'
#' @param hg A [text_hypergraph()], [knn_hypergraph()], or any Nestimate
#'   `net_hypergraph`.
#' @return A hypergraph whose incidence is the transpose of `hg`'s: a
#'   `text_hypergraph` with flipped `nodes` for bag constructions, otherwise
#'   a `net_hypergraph`. Accepted by all `hg_*` verbs.
#' @examples
#' hg <- text_hypergraph(c(a = "salt and soup", b = "soup and stars"))
