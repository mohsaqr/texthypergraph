# Build a weighted hypergraph from a text corpus

Tokenizes a corpus (base R, deterministic) and builds a weighted
hypergraph through the `Nestimate` engines, in one of three
constructions:

## Usage

``` r
text_hypergraph(
  x,
  column = NULL,
  id = NULL,
  construction = c("bag", "window", "knn"),
  nodes = c("doc", "word"),
  weight = c("n", "tfidf"),
  stop_words = NULL,
  min_count = 1L,
  lowercase = TRUE,
  window = 3L,
  window_mode = c("sliding", "tumbling"),
  k = 10L,
  embeddings = NULL,
  model = NULL,
  sparse = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A character vector of documents, or a `data.frame` containing a text
  column.

- column:

  Name of the text column when `x` is a `data.frame`.

- id:

  Optional name of an ID column when `x` is a `data.frame`; its values
  (unique, non-missing) become the document identifiers. Defaults to the
  names of `x` when it is a named character vector, otherwise `"doc_1"`,
  `"doc_2"`, ...

- construction:

  `"bag"` (default), `"window"`, or `"knn"` – see Details.

- nodes:

  Which entity is the vertex set for the bag construction: `"doc"`
  (default) or `"word"`. Ignored by `"window"` (vertices are words) and
  `"knn"` (vertices are documents).

- weight:

  Term weighting for the bag construction: `"n"` (raw count, default) or
  `"tfidf"`. The window construction always weights by window counts;
  the knn construction by cosine similarity.

- stop_words:

  Optional character vector of words to drop after tokenization
  (compared after lowercasing when `lowercase = TRUE`); see
  [`stop_words_en()`](https://mohsaqr.github.io/texthypergraph/reference/stop_words_en.md).
  Not applicable to `"knn"`.

- min_count:

  Minimum total corpus count for a word to be kept (default `1L`, keep
  everything). Not applicable to `"knn"`.

- lowercase:

  Lowercase the text before tokenization (default `TRUE`).

- window:

  Window size in tokens for `construction = "window"` (default `3L`).

- window_mode:

  `"sliding"` (default) or `"tumbling"`, for `construction = "window"`.

- k:

  Number of nearest neighbors per hyperedge for `construction = "knn"`
  (default `10L`).

- embeddings:

  Numeric matrix of document embeddings for `construction = "knn"`: one
  row per document, either rownames matching the document IDs or rows in
  document order. `NULL` (default) encodes the text with `sbert`.

- model:

  Passed to `sbert::encode()` when embeddings are computed (`NULL` =
  sbert's default model).

- sparse:

  Store the incidence as a `Matrix::dgCMatrix` (bag construction only,
  default `FALSE`). Sparse hypergraphs scale to tens of thousands of
  documents;
  [`hg_cluster()`](https://mohsaqr.github.io/texthypergraph/reference/hg_cluster.md),
  [`hg_classify()`](https://mohsaqr.github.io/texthypergraph/reference/hg_classify.md),
  [`hg_pagerank()`](https://mohsaqr.github.io/texthypergraph/reference/hg_pagerank.md),
  and
  [`hg_measures()`](https://mohsaqr.github.io/texthypergraph/reference/hg_measures.md)
  use sparse operator paths that agree with the dense engines (tested),
  while tensor centralities and the null test currently require the
  dense representation.

## Value

An object of class `c("text_hypergraph", "net_hypergraph")` – a
[`Nestimate::bipartite_groups()`](https://saqr.me/Nestimate/reference/bipartite_groups.html)
hypergraph accepted by every Nestimate hypergraph verb and by
[`hg_measures()`](https://mohsaqr.github.io/texthypergraph/reference/hg_measures.md),
[`hg_centrality()`](https://mohsaqr.github.io/texthypergraph/reference/hg_centrality.md),
[`hg_cluster()`](https://mohsaqr.github.io/texthypergraph/reference/hg_cluster.md),
and
[`hg_classify()`](https://mohsaqr.github.io/texthypergraph/reference/hg_classify.md)
– with a `text` field recording the corpus tables. Use
[`as.data.frame.text_hypergraph()`](https://mohsaqr.github.io/texthypergraph/reference/as.data.frame.text_hypergraph.md)
for the tidy weight table, and its `what` argument for the document and
vocabulary tables.

## Details

- `construction = "bag"` (default): the document-word incidence. With
  `nodes = "doc"`, documents are vertices and each word is a hyperedge
  over the documents containing it (the orientation for document
  clustering and transductive classification, Hayashi et al. 2020); with
  `nodes = "word"` the orientation reverses (the HyperGAT
  sentence-as-hyperedge setup generalized to whole documents).

- `construction = "window"`: words are vertices and every token window
  is a hyperedge – the sliding-window sequential construction of Ding et
  al. (2020, Sec. 3.2), extended with weights: each hyperedge is a
  distinct window content (the sorted set of words co-occurring in a
  window) and its incidence weight is the number of windows with that
  content. Windows never cross document boundaries.
  `window_mode = "sliding"` moves one token at a time (a document
  shorter than `window` forms one whole-document window); `"tumbling"`
  uses consecutive chunks, trailing partial chunk included. With
  `window = 2`, the off-diagonal pairwise co-occurrence counts implied
  by the hypergraph equal `Nestimate::wtna(method = "cooccurrence")`
  exactly (tested); the diagonals differ by design, since `wtna()`
  counts within-window repeats while a set-valued hyperedge collapses
  them.

- `construction = "knn"`: documents are vertices and each document plus
  its `k` nearest neighbors in an embedding space is one hyperedge,
  weighted by cosine similarity (see
  [`knn_hypergraph()`](https://mohsaqr.github.io/texthypergraph/reference/knn_hypergraph.md)).
  Pass a precomputed `embeddings` matrix, or leave it `NULL` to encode
  the text with the `sbert` package (if installed; models download only
  on explicit user confirmation, per sbert's policy).

Tokens are maximal runs of letters (with internal apostrophes); digits
and punctuation are separators. `weight = "tfidf"` (bag construction
only) uses the smoothed formula `tf * (log((1 + N) / (1 + df)) + 1)`
with `tf` the raw count, `N` the number of documents, and `df` the
word's document frequency – the `smooth_idf` variant of Manning,
Raghavan and Schutze (2008) as popularized by scikit-learn, which is
never zero and so never silently disconnects a vertex. `stop_words` and
`min_count` filtering happen before windowing, so removing a token
closes the gap it leaves in the sequence.

## Conditions

Raises `thg_bad_input` (broken argument contract, including bag-only
arguments passed to other constructions), `thg_empty_corpus` (no
document survives tokenization and filtering), `thg_missing_embeddings`
(`construction = "knn"` with neither `embeddings` nor the sbert
package), and warns with `thg_dropped_documents` when some documents end
up empty.
